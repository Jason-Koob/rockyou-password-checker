# rockyou-password-checker
Using SQLite3, I have created a database some of the passwords from the rockyou data breach in 2009. The python scripts allow you to store website credentials such as website name, URL, usernames and passwords. The scripts then check if any of your passwords are shared with those found in the rockyou data breach and alert you.
